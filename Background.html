        <h3>My academic background</h3>
        <article class="p1">
        <p style="font-style: italic;">I was born and rasied in Madison. I have three older siblings, I am the youngest.
            I lived on the east side until I was eight, then I moved
            to the west side. For highschool I moved districts to Monona Grove. I was a much different
            enviorment and pace than I was used to. Though, I was able to join and stay in the ITA program 
            for my entire highschool career. I didn't go back to in-person school until my junior year.
            Although highschool was pretty tough, and the COVID quaratine was rough for me 
            mentally, I was able to finish highschool strong.

            <article class = "p2"> <p>I applied to UW-Milwaukee as a computer
            science major. After two years, I transfered to UW-Madison, I am now an Information Science
            and CHICLA major. Even though I transfered, I miss MIlwaukee everyday. But, I cannot wait
            to continue my journey in Madison. Below is a photo of Me and my friend at our
            UW-Milwaukee orientation.
